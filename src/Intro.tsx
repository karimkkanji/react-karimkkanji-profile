            Strong believer in creating solutions and solving problems using
            Software. In my career, software is my core passion and what I
            enjoy doing the most. I love computers and have loved them since
            when I was a toddler back in 2002 where computers would facinate
            me and thus growing the passion in Computing and Information
            Technology.
